# TOA (Time Of Arrival)

- This code is able to triangulate the position from a source of waves with:
    1. The coordinates of at least **3** waves receptors.
    1. The **exact time** in that each receptor catches the wave.
    1. The velocity of the wave.
   
If you are interested in a more **mathematical** and **_deep_** explanation here is a PDF document [here](./docs/EXPLANATION.pdf).
